			<p>Their Journey</p></div>
		<div class="description"> 
			<p>Cristina Rodriguez immigrated to America from Cuba around 1964 because of Fidel Castro. Her family worked for the government, but her father was imprisoned because of Fidel Castro. Her parents wanted her to come to America before something happened to the her and her siblings. She could only bring a small bag containing an extra pair of clothes, maybe some documentation, a baby picture of herself, and a few other possessions.
