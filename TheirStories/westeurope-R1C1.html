			<p>Their Journey</p></div>
		<div class="description"> 
			<p>My grandparents, Rosi and Gerd Heinsohn, whom I call Omi and Opa, and my mother, Ingrid, left Germany with 5 trunks, 2 suitcases of belongings, and $27 in pocket in 1955. Omi and Opa had an American friend who found a sponsor necessary for them to immigrate to the United States. Opa was a refugee from Guben, a town in Eastern Germany, had lost his home, and had been taken Prisoner of War in the American zone in 1945 and was released 1946.

 		<div class="description"> 
			<p>Omi, Opa, and Ingrid (who was 2 years, 2 months) arrived in Hoboken, NJ May 5th 1955. Omi describes the boat trip as discouraging because she was very seasick. Their friend picked them up at the harbor, where they experienced New York City for the first time. The newly arrived family drove to Philadelphia where they found temporary housing in a friend’s house. It was 1 room, included a small kitchen, and the bathroom was shared.</p>
