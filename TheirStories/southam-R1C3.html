 		<div class="description"> 
			<p>Sanchez's family saved up enough money to move to Suncrest, a nicer area of their town. They are proud that they can buy designer clothes, take vacations, cars and develop their dream house in America. Although she does not remember much, Sanchez remembers the Peruvian culture that her family brought with them to America.</p>
