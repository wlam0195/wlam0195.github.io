		<div class="description"> 
			<p>On August 13, 2009, Missoula YMAC offered permanent residency and a job for Auraz. He decided to cross into the United States by swimming through the Guantanamo Bay, the waters dividing the Cuban and US controlled territories. On November 20, 1993, after months of practicing, he successfully swam across. He only brought his ID card, swimsuit and waterproof wristwatch.
