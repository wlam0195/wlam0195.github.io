		<div class="description"> 
			<p>When she was a young girl, a bomb from the Allied Powers exploded on Wallenmeyer and her family’s home. As a result of this traumatic event, she grew up to realize she would have a better life and greater opportunities if she immigrated to America. In 1957, Wallenmeyer applied for her visa and green card. She had to leave within four months or else the visa would expire.
