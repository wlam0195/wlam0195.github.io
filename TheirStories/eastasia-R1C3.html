			<p>Their Journey</p></div>
		<div class="description"> 
			<p>In the 1990s, Zhao Lu's siblings decided to immigrate to the United States for a better life. Prior to his departure, he worked as a federal inventory control specialist and clerk at the post office. Knowing the difficulties ahead, he brought a suitcase full of cook books to help his brother as a fry cook in the kitchens.
