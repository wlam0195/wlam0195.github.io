			<p>Chi Yau Lam was born on October 25, 1963 in Guangdong, China. In 1980's, Lam immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong with his fiance's wedding dress, immigration papers, and less than $100 in his pocket. He would be the first in his family to immigrate to the United States. Prior to his departure, Lam attended attending technical school for print production in Hong Kong.
