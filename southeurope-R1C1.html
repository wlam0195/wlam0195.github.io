			<p>Their Journey</p></div>
		<div class="description"> 
			<p>Francesco DiPinto arrived on Ellis Island from Bisceglie, Italy in 1912 with a small bag and the clothes on his back. He married Lucia Capurso. Francesco, a fisherman by trade, and his wife moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, which they knew about through family connections. Neither could speak English, though they were both literate in their native dialect. According to their immigration papers, their reason for immigrating was "poverty.".
